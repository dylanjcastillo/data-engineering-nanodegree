## List of projects

The Nanodegree consists of 5 assignments/projects after each course and a final capstone project:

### P1.A: Data Modeling with Postgres

This project comprises the scripts required for building a database (using a *star schema*) and including all the ETL processes, for a fictitious startup called Sparkify. This company had been collecting data on user activity from their music streaming application, and storing them as JSON files. However, this rudimentary way of storing data generated some difficulties for them regarding performing queries and extract insights from the data.

During this project, a Postgres database and relevant tables are setup, to allow the Sparkify analytics team access, aggregate and generate insights from their usersâ€™ data. Check the project [here](P1A/README.md):
